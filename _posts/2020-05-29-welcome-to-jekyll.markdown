    <h2>Outcome & Impact</h2>
    <p>The updated version of the Synology Account was launched worldwide on March 22, 2022, which greatly enhanced the user experience for 4 million users.</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The Synology Account is a platform for managing accounts for Synology users. It gives access to Synology's online services such as QuickConnect, Active Insight, and C2. In addition, users need to utilize the Synology Account services in order to sign up for Synology Events or participate in the community.</p>
    <p>As the number of products that are linked to the Synology Account within the company increases, the functions of the previous version of the account platform are not enough anymore. Therefore, the old website needs to be updated and revised. The redesign includes not only adding new features but also improving the existing information architecture.</p>

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
