Hello ðŸ‘‹ I am Beite,

I am a product manager and marketing professional with 7 years of experience in the tech industry. I have successfully designed and launched app and SaaS products. Expertise in Product Management, Market Survey, and Marketing Strategy (including Growth Marketing and Product Marketing) for both B2B and B2C products.

I began my career as a marketing specialist, where I handled various aspects of marketing, including B2B to B2C marketing, digital marketing, and channel marketing. As part of my job, I frequently traveled to Southeast Asia, which sparked ideas for improving our products. This ultimately led me to transfer teams and transition into the role of a product manager.

My marketing and literary background allows me to understand marketing dilemmas and think from a human perspective, and professionally, Iâ€™m able to transfer business concepts into a final product. I am in interested in exploring different products and opportunies. ðŸŒ¿
